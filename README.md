# note-taker

## Description

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

I built a note-taking application for users that need to keep track of a lot of information. The application allows the user to take notes and have written information available when needed. 

The application functions by:

* Allowing users to create and save notes

* View previously saved notes

* Delete previously saved notes
